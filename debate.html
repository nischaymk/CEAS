            <p>The dignitaries inaugurated the Student Edition of the U.S.-India Cooperation Circle. Post the final round the dignitaries sat down to engage and interact with all participants and motivated students to answer questions and discuss the implications of the upcoming U.S. elections, foreign policy and relations between India and the U.S. The students demonstrated a vibrant contrast of stances, and the speakers clarified their viewpoints and elaborated on the implications of winning popular votes and electoral votes. The contrast between issues tormenting India and those plaguing the U.S. presented unique perspectives on finding solutions. The importance of continuing the good relations of India and the U.S. for the mutual growth of both nations was brought to light. Inspiring the students to engage in politics and consistently remain aware of global issues, the speakers concluded the discussion and awarded the winning team and runners-up.</p>
