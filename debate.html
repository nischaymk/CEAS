                presidential elections in the United States will redefine the strategic partnership between the
                two countries” at the final round of debate. The judges of the final round were U.S. Political
                operatives Ms Alison Williams, Ms Dasheika Ruffin and U.S. Consulate’s Public Diplomacy
                Officer Mr Eric Atkins.

            <p>The dignitaries inaugurated the Student Edition of the U.S.-India Cooperation Circle. Post
            the final round the dignitaries sat down to engage and interact with all participants and
            motivated students to answer questions and discuss the implications of the upcoming U.S.
            elections, foreign policy and relations between India and the U.S. The students
            demonstrated a vibrant contrast of stances, and the speakers clarified their viewpoints and
            elaborated on the implications of winning popular votes and electoral votes. The contrast
            between issues tormenting India and those plaguing the U.S. presented unique perspectives
            on finding solutions. The importance of continuing the good relations of India and the U.S.
            for the mutual growth of both nations was brought to light. Inspiring the students to engage in
            politics and consistently remain aware of global issues, the speakers concluded the
            discussion and awarded the winning team and runners-up.
            Following the award ceremony, distinguished guests met with the Vice Chancellor Fr Joseph

            strengthening ties through the U.S.-India Cooperation Circle, the event marked the advent of
            further partnerships. A first step toward strengthening ties through the U.S.-India Cooperation Circle.</p>
